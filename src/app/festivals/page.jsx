            <p>
              Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of India&apos;s most
              widely celebrated festivals, symbolizing the victory of light over
              darkness and good over evil. It marks the return of Lord Rama to
              Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana and is celebrated
              with immense enthusiasm across the country.
            </p>

            <p>
              The festival typically spans five days, with each day holding its
              own significance and rituals. Homes and streets are adorned with
              colorful rangolis (artistic designs made with colored powders),
              diyas (earthen lamps), and decorative lights, creating a
              mesmerizing spectacle of lights and colors.
            </p>

              and share festive meals. Fireworks light up the night sky, adding
              to the festive cheer. Diwali is also a time for new beginnings,
              with people cleaning and decorating their homes, buying new

              Holi, often dubbed as the festival of colors, is a joyous
              celebration of spring, love, and the triumph of good over evil. It
              is marked by playful gatherings where people smear each other with
              vibrant colored powders and water, sing and dance to traditional
              folk songs, and indulge in festive sweets and drinks.

              the legend of Prahlad and Holika, symbolizing the victory of
              devotion and righteousness over tyranny and malevolence. Bonfires
              are lit on the eve of Holi to signify the burning of evil spirits.
